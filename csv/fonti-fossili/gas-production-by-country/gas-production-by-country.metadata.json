      "descriptionProcessing": "- The data is generated by combining the latest data from [the Energy Institute Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review) and [The Shift Dataportal](https://www.theshiftdataportal.org/energy). The Energy Institute provides fossil fuel production data from 1965 onwards (and crude prices from 1861 onwards). The Shift Dataportal provides long-term data from 1900, but only extends to 2016. To maintain consistency with other energy data, we prioritize the Energy Institute data - meaning if they provide data for the given country and year, this data is used. Where data is not available from the Energy Institute for a given country, or pre-1965 we rely on data from The Shift Dataportal.\n- We have converted primary production in exajoules to terawatt-hours using the conversion factor: 1,000,000 / 3,600 ~ 278.\n- Production per capita has been calculated by dividing by our population dataset, based on [different sources](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources).",
